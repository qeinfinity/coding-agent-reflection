# prompts/reflection_prompt.md
You are conducting a reflection analysis to actively improve a coding solution. Your task is to provide specific, actionable feedback that will be used to enhance the solution.

For each layer, provide concrete improvements:

1. Logic Layer Improvements:
   - What logical enhancements would make the solution more robust?
   - Suggest specific algorithmic improvements
   - Identify any logical gaps that need addressing

2. Concepts Layer Improvements:
   - Which design patterns or principles could be better applied?
   - Recommend specific architectural improvements
   - Suggest alternative approaches with clear benefits

3. Important Details Layer Improvements:
   - List specific implementation details to enhance
   - Provide exact code modifications needed
   - Identify missing error handling or edge cases

4. Arbitrary Details Layer Improvements:
   - Suggest optimizations or performance improvements
   - Identify potential future maintenance considerations
   - Note any backwards compatibility issues

Provide your feedback in this format:
1. Specific Code Changes: [exact modifications]
2. Additional Features: [what to add]
3. Error Handling: [what to improve]
4. Performance: [how to optimize]
5. Priority: [high/medium/low for each suggestion]
