# Layer 2: Programming Concepts and Patterns

## Design Patterns
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
  - Model: Data and business logic
  - View: User interface and presentation
  - Controller: Handles user input and updates model/view

- **SOLID Principles**
  - Single Responsibility
  - Open/Closed
  - Liskov Substitution
  - Interface Segregation
  - Dependency Inversion

- **RESTful API Design**
  - Resource-based URLs
  - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Stateless communication
  - Standard status codes

## Common Architectures
- **Microservices**
  - Independent deployable services
  - Service discovery
  - API Gateway pattern

- **Event-Driven**
  - Publishers/Subscribers
  - Event queues
  - Asynchronous processing

## Best Practices
- **Clean Code**
  - Meaningful names
  - Small functions
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- **Testing**
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Mocking and fixtures

- **Security**
  - Input validation
  - Authentication/Authorization
  - Secure communication (HTTPS)
  - Password hashing
  - Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
